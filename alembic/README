Alembic Database Migrations
===========================

This directory contains Alembic migrations for DHRUVA-PGRS database schema.

## Common Commands

### Create a new migration (autogenerate)
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations (upgrade to latest)
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback one migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Check current migration version
```bash
alembic current
```

### View migration history
```bash
alembic history
```

### Rollback to specific revision
```bash
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

## Migration Files

Migration files are stored in `alembic/versions/` directory.
Each file represents a database schema change and can be applied or rolled back.

## Important Notes

1. **Never modify migration files after they've been applied to production**
2. **Always test migrations on development/staging before production**
3. **Review autogenerated migrations - they may need manual adjustments**
4. **Migrations are reversible - each has upgrade() and downgrade()**
5. **Keep migrations small and focused on single changes**

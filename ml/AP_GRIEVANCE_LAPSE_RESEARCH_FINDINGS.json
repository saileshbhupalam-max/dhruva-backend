Found 8 documented cases (2 individual, 6 aggregate) with high confidence (85-95%). Major limitation: Individual case-level data is extremely scarce in public domain. Most available information is statistical/aggregate showing systemic issues rather than case-specific details. Key findings: 29,400 cases reopened due to faulty resolutions, 78% dissatisfaction rate despite 90% official resolution claim, 175,000 unaudited applications. Dominant lapses identified: Premature closure (lapse #6), Inordinate delay (#9), Inadequate action (#8), No proper enquiry (#5), Closed without documents (#4). Revenue Department (230,000 complaints) and land mutation issues are most prominent. NTR and Annamayya districts show worst performance (90% dissatisfaction). For ML training: Recommend using aggregate patterns to create synthetic examples, filing RTI requests for detailed data, and ongoing monitoring of news sources for individual case reports.",
